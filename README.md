### Section II : Analytics Consumption
	- On CAST Highlight Home Page You can See Majorly 3 Big Dashboards 
		1. Software Health - Majors the Overall Health of Software - Based on Software industry standards and practices.
		2. Cloud Ready - How ready application is to be migrated to cloud.
		3. Open Source Safety - Majors How safe application is with the open source packages/libraries that used in application.
	- There are Majorly 3 parameters which judges the Software Health 
		1. Software Agility 
			- Majored on basis of How quick & easily application can be upgraded and maintained.  
		2. Software Resiliency 
			- Majored on How much application is Robust, It's majorment of How likely production issues can be solved in short span. 
			- In Software Resiliency Dashboard we will have two axis (X & Y)
				- X axis - We have Software Resiliency -measurement of Software reliability - 
				- Y axis - We have Business Impact- On Scal of 0 to 100 -- This data comes from series of Survey Questions
			- we will see the bubles in dashboards Green , Oranges , red - Green is Good quality , Oranges are middle one and Red are alarming in quality
		3. Software Elegence 
			- It is pure complexity majorment.
	- Portfolio Demographic dashboards
		1. This type of dashboards provide inventory of all the different technologies being used accorss a portfolio of applications along with various Health Scores(Software Resiliency, Software Agility and Software Elegence Scores).
		2. This type of Dashboards helps to understand potentially area(technology) where they need to provide kind of training or knowledge improvement plan according to the score.
		3. The technology mix comes entirely from the code scan analysis
		4. Within this dashboard, the Software Health Metrics are consolidated by technology
	- Application Categories Dashboard
		1. This dashboard uses four of our metrics Resiliency, agility , Elegence and cloud ready as well as business impact coming from surveys and additinally its segaments each application of the portfolio into a category type.
		2. This type of dashboard helps us to identify that there are multiple applications in this similar category some of them are having higher Resilienc scores than others 
		   and may be we can identify opportunities for potentially consolidation or retirement of application that are redudant 
		   and some that are potentially less healthy than other applicatios performing same function.
		3. The shapes that represent the applications differ based on the typology (Custom App, COTS, Customized COTS, etc.).
		4. The X-axis can be changed to represent various survey questions available in a drop down list. 
		5. The Application Categories Dashboard helps identify applications that might overlap i.e. provide the same capabilities.
	- Software maintainance Dashboard
		1. It compares the recorded maintainance efforts for each application and accorss the portfolio with  the recommended maintainance efforts based on COCOMO-II mode.
		2. it gives opportunities to identify opportunities for optimazation of resources as you may find application using more resources than recommended resources.
		3. The Yellow Bars into the charts correspond to the recommended maintenance effort
	- Trend Dashboard
		1. This dashboard allows us to monitor metrics of the portfolio over time.
	- Software Compositions Dashboard 
		1. Allows us to analyze entire portfolio on open source risk and other metrics
		2. It having screen which compares Business Impact with open source safety, component view , vulnerability views and licesne risks.
	- Business Impact Dashboard
		1. The Business Impact score comes from the computation of some Survey Answers, 
		2. The X axis can be changed to represent Software Resiliency, Agility or Elegance, 
		3. The Business Impact Dashboard helps segment the portfolio and make decisions on which apps to keep, retire, merge or re-prioritize
		4. The Business Impact is a weighted average. It's computed using the survey answers provided by Application Owners.
	- Cloud Ready Dashboard
		1. It is a Core dashboard which forecast highlight 
		2. on this dashboard we have cloud readiness on horizontal axis and business impact on vertical axis 
		3. This is a great dashboard for segmenting and prioritizing large portfolio of the application for cloud migration 
		4. The CloudReady Decision Matrix Dashboard enables users to change the bubble size to represent the number of Roadblocks, Total FTE, and Code Lines
		5. this dashboard can be found via the tab called "Health Factors".The X axis can be switched into any Health Factors and the size of the bubbles can be either: Roadblocks, Code Lines, Business Impacts, Backfired Function Points or Total FTE.
	- CAST Highlight is provided the Custom Dashboard facility as well.
	- Application Result Dashboard 
		1. This dashboard is useful for performing advanced filtering  
		2. Example - If you want to see or filter the applications from large portfolio of 200 applications , which having highest software Resilienc, Highest Agility and Highest Elegence and cloud readiness
			- By using this dashboard you can simply apply those filters and it will show the expected applications as result.
		3. It also supports export with 3 different formate - CSV, XML, and Powerpoint
		4. The Application Results Dashboard uses an Advanced Filter option that enables users to define min & max values to narrow down the population of application
	- Open Source Safety Dashboard 
		1. By default, the bubble size is set to represent number of lines of code. 
		2. This dashboard helps identify where to prioritize efforts to address open source risks across the portfolio.
	- Application Level Tabs
		1. Health Distribution tab
			- The dashboard helps quickly identify the technology mix of the application
			- The dashboard helps analyze an application across health factors & technology
		2. Software Composition tab
			- CAST Highlight integrates with the NIST/MITRE Database to get the Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures (CVEs) that are identified within the components in use
			- Not paying attention to CVEs can lead to severe breaches of security due to cyberattacks.
		3. Code Insights Tab
			- The code insights can be exported to Excel(The code insights, regardless the health factors they are associated to, can be exported to an Excel file thanks to the top right button "Export to Excel)
			- Additional Definitions & Recommendations about each code insight are available
		4. CloudReady Index Tab
			- The CloudReady Index is by default computed based on a survey & a code scan, 
			- CAST Highlight identifies the files where the roadblocks appear
		5. ROAR Index? (Ranking of Application Risks)
			- It is a composite metric that includes a weighted average of the three health factors balanced with the business impact of the application.
			- The higher the ROAR index, the more critical & risky the application
		6. Benchmark Tab
			- The applications outside of the active portfolio are anonymized, 
			- The benchmark can be filtered by the technology, the number of users or the typology
	- Export Capabilities
		1. The PowerPoint export can be done from the Application Results Dashboard targeting ALL or ONE part of the application population 
			- From the Right hand side Menu through "My Watchlist' and the button "Download PPT Report" which will ONLY extract the apps belonging to that list.

			- The closing date represents the target due date. In case some applications have not yet been analyzed when we go past this date, the campaign appears as "Late" but won't stop automatically.
		5. Click on Next and You will shown screen where we need to choose 
			- Include Code Scan - ON /OFF 
			- Include Survey answerss - ON/OFF 
			To fully utilize the CAST Highlight use both ON 
			- But when you want to omit one or the other example 
				1. You are analyzing a pure COTS portfolio with no access to code you would emit the code scan in this case
				2. You may also choose omit the survey if this is a followup campain where survey is already completed in previous campaign.
			- Select the survey which you want to include and click next step
			- When defining the scope, the Portfolio Manager can choose the domains/sub domains to get all the associated applications OR, select the applications one by one.
			- Please note that the selection fields are dynamic and adapt while typing the first letters of the domain or application names
		6. You will see the Application Scope 
			- Here you need to select Domain and Application.
		7. Lastly you will see the Notification section where you can write your custome message for responders, It is best practices to give details in the message.
		8. This above steps will create campaign and now you can run that campaign. this will trigger emails to responders and tell them that its time to respond.
